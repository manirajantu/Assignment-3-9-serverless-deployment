# Serverless Deployment: Assignment

## Brief

Discuss in your project to:

1. Determine what the project use cases your group wants to work on for Module 3 project week.
2. (Optional) If your group has an idea what to do for capstone project and it has a backend APIs, you may work on the backend on module 3.
3. You should think about what kind of integration is required for your project. Example, if you are working on digital signing related, you may need to integrate with external APIs like [DocuSign](https://www.docusign.com/) or [PandaDoc](https://www.pandadoc.com/). In some cases you may need libreoffice or other forms of software to generate documents.
4. Consider whether you will be using real database. Consider [Heroku PostgreSQL](https://www.heroku.com/postgres).
5. Consider whether you will be attempting serverless function. Consider [Heroku Functions](https://elements.heroku.com/buttons/jmonster/heroku-as-a-function-example).
6. After you have discussed the items above with your group, start researching on which cloud solutions suit your deployment plan (in case you prefer to use other cloud platforms other than the suggested Heroku).

```
// Which deployment platform will your group be using?

We are using Heroku with postgres database.
